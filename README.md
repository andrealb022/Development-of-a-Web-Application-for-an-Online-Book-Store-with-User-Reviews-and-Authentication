# Development-of-a-Web-Application-for-an-Online-Book-Store-with-User-Reviews-and-Authentication
This project involves the design and implementation of a web application for an online store, where users can view product information and leave reviews. The system supports both anonymous and authenticated users, with authenticated users having access to a personal area. The application includes user authentication, a search feature, and review management, ensuring secure and efficient interactions. For the frontend, HTML and CSS are used to create the user interface, while JavaScript is employed to enhance interactivity. On the backend, PHP is utilized to manage database interactions and handle authentication, product details, and review functionality. The backend database efficiently stores and manages user, product, and review data.
